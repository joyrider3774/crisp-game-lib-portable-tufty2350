This is a repo containing the Pimoroni's tufty2350 port of the crisp games library which is a Minimal C-lang library for creating classic arcade-like mini-games running on devices and browsers. 
Re-implemented version of [crisp-game-lib](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib) for smaller devices. You can play [sample games in your browser](https://abagames.github.io/crisp-game-lib-portable/build/).

## Controls:
- **Button B**: A Button / main action
- **Button BOOT / HOME**: B Button / Return to game selection menu
- **Button UP**: Up in game selection / move purple mouse cursor up in mouse games
- **Button DOWN**: Down in game selection / move purple mouse cursor down in mouse games
- **Button A**: move purple mouse cursor left in mouse games
- **Button C**: move purple mouse cursor right in mouse games

## Credits
- Crisp games library portable and it's games are made by user [abagames](https://github.com/abagames)
- This tufty2350 port by joyrider3774
- Extra games ported by joyrider3774, from SDL port
- glcdfont.h: Adafruit_GFX font mainly used internally to display debug information on an internal buffer

## Notes 
this repo uses a fork of pimoroni-pico where a change has been made to not build the examples but also a change to the old st7789 driver to make it work with the overlocking done on tufty .
rp2350. You could still use the original repo if you disable / comment the overclocking in pimoroni_tufty2350.h in the boards directory. The micropython firmware also runs at 200mhz and the 
pimoroni_tufty2350.h header comes from there hence why it applies the same overlock

## How to write your own game

1. Copy [game_Template.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/main/src/games/game_Template.c) to `game[your game name].c`

1. Comment out other games in [menuGameList.c](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/blob/main/src/lib/menuGameList.c) and add `void addGame[your game name]();` and `addGame[your game name]()`

   ```
   ...(snip)...
   void addGameReflector();
   void addGame[your game name]();

   void addGames() {
     /*addGameThunder();
     ...(snip)...
     addGameReflector();*/
     addGame[your game name]();
   }
   ```

1. Write your own game in `game[your game name].c` and rename `void addGame_Template() {` to `void addGame[your game name]() {`

1. [Build for browser](#browser) and debug

1. Once the game is complete, revert other games that were commented out in [menuGameList.c](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/blob/main/src/lib/menuGameList.c) and build it for other devices

## How to port the library to other devices

The source codes for [library](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/tree/main/src/lib) and [games](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/tree/main/src/games) are written device-independent. Besides, you need to implement device-dependent code for the following functions:

- Device initialization function (e.g. `setup()` in Arduino) that calls `initGame()`

- Frame update function (e.g. `loop()` in Arduino) that calls `setButtonState()` and `updateFrame()`

  - The state of the button press must be notified to the library with the `setButtonState()`

- Drawing and audio processing functions that are defined in [machineDependent.h](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/blob/main/src/lib/machineDependent.h)
  - `md_getAudioTime()` function should return the audio timer value in seconds
  - `md_playTone(float freq, float duration, float when)` function should play a tone with `freq` frequency, `duration` length (in seconds) and staring from `when` seconds on the audio timer
  - `md_drawCharacter(unsigned char grid[CHARACTER_HEIGHT][CHARACTER_WIDTH][3], float x, float y, int hash)` function should draw the pixel art defined by `grid[y][x][r, g, b]` at position (x, y). Since `hash` will be the same for the same pixel art, you can cache pixel art images using `hash` as an index and avoid redrawing the same image

Sample device-dependent codes are [cglpM5StickCPlus.ino](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/blob/main/src/cglpM5StickCPlus/cglpM5StickCPlus.ino) and [cglpPyBadge.ino](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/blob/main/src/cglpPyBadge/cglpPyBadge.ino).

## Porting games from crisp-game-lib using an AI chatbot

You can use an AI chatbot to port game source code for crisp-game-lib to crisp-game-lib-portable. By providing the [prompt](./convert_prompt/prompt.txt) and [set of files](./convert_prompt/knowledge/) to the chatbot, you can obtain the code ported to the C language. I have tried this using [Claude 3 Opus](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family), but it is expected to work to some extent with other LLMs as well. The ported code is not perfect, so it needs to be manually checked and corrected.
